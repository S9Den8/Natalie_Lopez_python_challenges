The Voynich manuscript has remained so far as a mystery for linguists and cryptologists.
While the text written on medieval parchment using an unknown script system shows basic statistical patterns that bear resemblance to those from real languages.
There are features that suggested to some researches that the manuscript was a forgery intended as a hoax. 
Here we analyse the long-range structure of the manuscript using methods from information theory. 
We show that the Voynich manuscript presents a complex organization in the distribution of words that is compatible with those found in real language sequences. 
We are also able to extract some of the most significant semantic word-networks in the text. 
These results together with some previously known statistical features of the Voynich manuscript, give support to the presence of a genuine message inside the book.



Summary of the article
The paper titled “Keywords and Co‑Occurrence Patterns in the Voynich Manuscript: 
An Information‑Theoretic Analysis” is authored by Marcelo A. Montemurro and Damia n H. Zanette, who are affiliated with the University of Manchester and the 
Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas in Argentina ().  
Using methods from information theory, the authors examine the long‑range statistical structure of the Voynich Manuscript—a medieval 
document written in an unknown script that has long puzzled linguists and cryptologists. 
Their analysis reveals that the manuscript exhibits a complex organization in word distribution that closely matches patterns found in genuine natural languages. 
Additionally, they identify significant semantic word‑networks within the text, suggesting meaningful relationships among words.  
These findings, together with previously reported statistical characteristics of the manuscript, support the hypothesis that the Voynich Manuscript 
contains a genuine, non‑random message rather than being a simple hoax ().
